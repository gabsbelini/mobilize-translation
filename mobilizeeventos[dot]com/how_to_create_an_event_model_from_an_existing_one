How to create an event model from an existing one?

When creating a New Event Model on mobilize events, the event manager has the option
to use an already created Model as a baseline.

This is interesting for the management of certain types of events that may have some similarity between them.

Lets go the steps:
  1. In the side menu, access the Event Models module.
  2. After choosing which model will serve as a baseline for the New Model, click in Duplicate.
