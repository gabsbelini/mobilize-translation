What is the organizer`s code and how can I generate it?

The organizer`s code is a sequency generated when an event organizer user of mobilize events invites a client user to the platform.
This code allows each user to create its own account inside the hired company's environment, with it's own password, picture and other personal information.

I'm an event host, how do I get an organizer's code??
If you're client of a company that organizes events, ask your manager or advisor to invite you to the App.

  1. The organizer will register your email;
  2. We'll send you an unique code in this email for you to be able to fulfill your registration.
  (pssst, always take a look into that spam box, alright?)
  3. You can click on the link in your email or copy the code into the registration page

  4. Done. Your registration is complete and you can start organizing your event at mobilize events!
