mobilize events system. It's a good place for you and your team to
 get your main questions cleared up.

 Access our Help Center! You always send us messages saying "I need help! Guys,
 how do I do this? And that?". We gather the most relevant answers at the Mobilize Events Help Center.
 Put this link into your favorites, it'll be very useful at the begining
 (after a couple of weeks you'll become a wizard at this!).

 Talk to us! We use to say that the implantation of the platform is the hardest part.
 It's common to have some questions popping up on the first days using the system. So,
