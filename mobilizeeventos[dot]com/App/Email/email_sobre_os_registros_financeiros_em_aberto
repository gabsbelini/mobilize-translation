Due bills {company's name}

The pending bills

The financial records below are already expired or are about to expire in the next couple of days.
As they haven't been paid yet we thought we should warn you:

Value|Due Date| Description|Category|Status
{registry list}

To set them as already paid, you just have to go into the Financial area of your company // Nao consegui achar ~dar baixa~ em ingles, nem sinonimos,
//coloquei ai tipo "pra definir eles como ja pagos, ......"
inside mobilize events and define them as paid, okay?

Button "Access my Financial area"

Best regards.
