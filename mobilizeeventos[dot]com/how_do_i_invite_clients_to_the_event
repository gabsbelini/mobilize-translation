Inviting your clients to help you in the organization of their event will,
beyond saving you time, help you make you stand out in the market.

Aside from gaining access to mobilize events, the client will start receiving
notifications about important activities related to his event.

Check out what we covered in this article:
  * Inviting the client to the Event
  * What does the client receive in the email:
  * How does the client's completing the registration page looks like?

Inviting the client to the Event

1. Acess the event: in the side menu, click on Events > Romeu and Juliet's Wedding (name of the event).
2. On the right side of the event's homepage, check out the users with access to that event:
[I M A G E]
USERS
//Pelo menos essa foi sussa
3. Click on the button (+)
4. Add the new user's information: the Email (used for notifications and login),
the Client's user profile and the Name.
[E G A M I] // É palavra ao contrario egami, legal ne?

5. Click on Invite. Your part of the job is done... now it's up to the client.

What does the client receive in the email?

Your client will receive an email telling that he has access to your company's
environment at mobilize events. In this email he will be able to click in the
link to fulfill the registration and generate his own password, according to the E G A M I below:

How does the client's registration completing page looks like?
By clicking on the link, the client will be redirected to a page similar to the one below.
On the right side, he will see that he is in your company's environment.
