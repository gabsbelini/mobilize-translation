How to manage an event's task list?

The Task List is a step-by-step of everything that should be done for the event to
succeed.

You, your client and your team will be able to collaborate in the organization of the event,
checking what's already done and sharing thoughts on what is being done.

Tip: You can generate your Task list automatically using an Event Model.

Accessing the Task List
To access an event's Task List, on the side menu click on: Events > Romeu and Juliet's
wedding (name of the event) > Tasks

You'll see something like this:
