Which notifications am I going ["gonna" informal] to receive via email?

At mobilize events, we are well aware that writing hundreds of emails to warn clients
and suppliers of event related stuff is one of the most boring parts of being an
event manager.

So, the mobilize automates a couple of these emails. With the notifications, we warn those
involved in the event about the important happenings.

The notifications are send in the mobilize events user's emails. We mark with an (*)
the ones that are sent only to administrators.

Types of Notifications

  1. Financial Control
  2. Pendencies from all events
  3. Pendencies from the event
  4. Last known activity
  5. Next appointments

We're going to discuss every one of them, starting with the financial notifications

1. Financial Control*

The management companies (administrator users) have access to the Financial module,
in order to control the revenues and expenses and the monthly balance.

The mobilize sends a notification with the Company's revenues and expenses that are still due.

When are these messages sent? Weekly, at monday mornings.
Who receives the notification? The admin registred email from mobilize environment.
