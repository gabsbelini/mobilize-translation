Frequently Asked Questions // Achei que ficaria melhor colocar FAQ do que "main doubts, most asked questions, etc..."

1. Does the subscription has any loyalty agreement period?
No. You subscribe to mobilize events and pay for the chosen period, being able to cancel
it whenever it expires. For example, on the monthly subscription you may cancel your
plan at any time.

2. I've done my subscription. May I change plans after that?
Yes. It is possible to change plans according to the number of events that
your company is organazing, be it for a bigger one or a smaller one.
(we hope it's for the bigger one, right?! hahah)

3. What are the accepted payment methods?
Bill of Exchange or credit card.

4. Ok, I've liked it. How do I make my subscription and how does it work?
Yayyy! Good, you sign onto mobilize events through [here](LINK).
After that, go to Settings>My plan, choose your payment method and fill in your data.
Subscribed? Great, now your billing will be sent to you every month in your email,
about 5 days prior to the deadline.

5. I still have some questions! :(
Don't worry. Talk to us and we will answer any question you might have. Send us an email
to tainan@mobilizeeventos.com or on Whats (44) 9 9704-5188, please? (:
