Where does the events that already took place go?

To make everything clearer, we show only the active events at the homepage: the
ones that didn't take place yet. (those who will still be organized) se quiser deixar igual ta no site,
é o que ta no parenteses, mudei pra aqueles que não aconteceram ainda pq achei melhor.

A doubt that many people have is: Where does the events that already took place go?

These events are still in the mobilize's base, for you to have a history. To
access them:
  1. On Home, to your right, click on the (...) button
  2. Select See All.
  3. Done! You'll see a list of all events that you've already organized! :)
