What is the difference between client and user?

The mobilize events is a collaborative event organization platform.

This means that you can invite people to collaborate with you
on the event organizations. As a user can also be a client, this raises some doubts.
I'll explain here, what is an User and a Client inside mobilize events.

What is an User?

Any person who can be invited to the system and has a login is a mobilize events User.

Types of Users
  - Administrator User: the responsible for the events organization company (ceremonialist)
  - Collaborator User: the collaborators and employees of the company (secretaries, assistants).
  - Usuário Cliente: the hosts of the events organized by the company (engaged couple,

  father of the engaged couple, graduates, business comission, etc).

  //se quiser pode colocar "sweet sixteen" dentro do parenteses, é bem parecido
  //com festa de 15 anos, mas só tem nos EUA, por enquanto deixei sem, você decide.

Each Event may have none, one or more Client Users.

What is a Client?

At mobilize events, the Client is the legal responsible for the Event.

Important and detailed informations about that event's contractor is stored
at the Client, it may be the host itself, a relative or a contracting company (
in the case of business events).

Each Event has only one Client.

Note: Saving a Client's data at mobilize events does not create an User. To do that,
add an User: the login will be created and sent by email to the client.
