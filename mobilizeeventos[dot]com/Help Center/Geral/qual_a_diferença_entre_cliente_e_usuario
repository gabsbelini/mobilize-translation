What is the difference between client and user?

The mobilize events is a collaborative event organization platform.

This means that you can invite people to collaborate with you
on the event organizations. As a user can also be a client, this raises some doubts.
I'll explain here, what is an User and a Client inside mobilize events.

What is an User?

Any person who can be invited to the system and has a login is a mobilize events User.

Types of Users
  - Administrator User: the responsible for the events organization company (ceremonialist)
  - Collaborator User: the collaborators and employees of the company (secretaries, assistants).
  - Usuário Cliente: the hosts of the events organized by the company (engaged couple,
  father of the engaged couple, graduates, business comission, etc).

Each Event may have none, one or more Client Users.

What is a Client?

At mobilize events, the Client is the legal responsible for the Event.

Important and detailed informations about that event's contractor is stored
at the Client, it may be the host itself, a relative or a contracting company (
in the case of business events).

Each Event has only one Client.

Note: Saving a Client's data at mobilize events does not create an User. To do that,
add an User: the login will be created and sent by email to the client.
