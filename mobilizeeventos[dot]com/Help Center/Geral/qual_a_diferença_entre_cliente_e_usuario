What is the difference between client and user?

The mobilize events is a collaborative event organization platform.

This means that you can invite people to collaborate with you
on the event organizations. As a user can also be a client, this raises some doubts.
I'll explain here, what is an User and a Client inside mobilize events.

What is an User?

Any person who can be invited to the system and has a login is a mobilize events User.

Types of Users
  - Administrator User: the responsible for the events organization company (ceremonialist)
  - Collaborator User: the collaborators and employees of the company (secretaries, assistants).
  - Usu√°rio Cliente: the hosts of the events organized by the company (engaged couple,
  engaged couple's parents, graduates, business commission, etc).

  Each Event might have none, one or more Client Users.

  What is a Client?

  At mobilize events, the Client is the legal responsible for the Event.

  Detailed information about that event's contractor are stored on the Client be it
  the host itself, a relative or the contracting company (in case of business events).

Each Event has only one Client

Observation:Saving the Client's information at mobilize events does not create an User.
To do that, add an User: the login will be created and sent by email to the client.
