What is the difference between client and user?

The mobilize events is a collaborative event organization platform.

This means that you can invite people to collaborate with you
on the event organizations. As a user can also be a client, this raises some doubts.
I'll explain here, what is an User and a Client inside mobilize events.

What is an User?

Any person who can be invited to the system and has a login is a mobilize events User.

Types of Users
  - Administrator User: the responsible for the events organization company (ceremonialist)
  - Collaborator User: the collaborators and employees of the company (secretaries, assistants).
  - Usu√°rio Cliente: the hosts of the events organized by the company (engaged couple,
  father of the engaged couple, graduates, )
