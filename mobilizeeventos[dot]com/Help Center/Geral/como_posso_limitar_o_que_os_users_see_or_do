How can I restrict what users see or do?

At mobilize events, you're able to restrict the access of your users so that the
system fits into your company's standarts. You make this type of control through
the Access Permissions.

Warning! Some settings in Access Permissions might drastically change the way your
environment works at mobilize events. If you have any doubts, get in touch with us first! :)

Mobilize counts, by default, on two User Profiles: Administrador and
Client. Thus, you can control both what your collaborators and your clients can access.

To choose which User Profile you want to manage, select the button:
