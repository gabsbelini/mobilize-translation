How to delete an Event?

This is a functionality that is "cloaked" on purpose, for being something that
shouldn't happen by accident, right?

But yes, it is possible to delete an event. To do that, follow these steps:
  1. Access the Event: on the side menu, click on Events > Romeu and Juliet`s Wedding
  (event's name).
  2. Click on the (...) button on the Event's top bar menu, located on the top
  of the page. (acho desnecess√°rio colocar esse "located on the top of the page")
  [IBAGEM]
  3. Click on the Delete event button.
  4. Confirm the exclusion.

Done! You learned how to delete an event, but ceased Neymar and Marquezine's
dream :(
