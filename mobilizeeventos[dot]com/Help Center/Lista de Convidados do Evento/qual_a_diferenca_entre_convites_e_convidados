What is the difference between Invitations and Guests?

The difference between Invitation and Guest is that an Invitation might have
one or more Guests.

Group Invitations

In events that have "group" invitations, that is, an invitation that contemplates
several people - it's the case of couples, families, friends' groups or coworkers -
the Invitation will have one name that refers to all guests.

Yet using this example, inside the "group" Invitation you will be able to add
every guest individually, inserting name, age range and later on confirm it's
presence individually.

See the example below:
  - Invitation: Mr. and Mrs. Sangalo
  - Guests: Maruan (Adult), Ivete(Adulto) and Petros (Child).

Individual Invitations

In the case that the event you're organizing has only individual Invitations,
that is, each Invitation represents an event's attendant, it's advised to manage
the List in a somewhat different way.

In this case, we suggest that you use the Guest's name as the Invitation title.

For the Guest counting and age ranges to stay organized, we also recommend that
you add a Guest inside the Invitation, being able to leave the name blank for obvious
reasons.

See the example below:
  - Invitation: Ivete Sangalo
  - Guests: --- (Adult)
