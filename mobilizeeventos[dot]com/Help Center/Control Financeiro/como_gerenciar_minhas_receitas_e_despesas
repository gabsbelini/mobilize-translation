How to manage my revenues and expenses?

Besides being an event management tool, mobilize events also allows you to
do the Financial Control of your company in an easy way.

Managing the revenues and expenses
  - Understanding the Financial module structure
  - Creating a financial movement

Understanding the Financial module structure

We developed a pretty simple and flexible Financial module, so that
you can use it the way you organize your bills.

+In and -Out

The financial movements are divided in Revenues and Expenses. Aside from the fact
that one brings lots of happiness to your accounting and the other not so much,
in the Financial module they don't have any other technical differences.

Categories

You can create unlimited Categories to group your movimentations. This gives you
the freedom to create groups such as "Fixed Expenses", "Marcos Sallary" or group
the revenues of an event using it's own name "Ivone and Neto wedding".

The Categories are very important because you'll be able to filter the movements
by category, acquiring very useful reports for the management of your company.

Creating a financial movement
  1. Access the Financial module by clicking on the ($) button on the side menu.
  You'll see a screen similar to this one:

the same steps.
