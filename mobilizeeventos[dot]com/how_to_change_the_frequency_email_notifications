    The mobilize events send some notifications via email to the users, such as the last known activity in the events, the due tasks and the next appointments, for example.
  The mangares and clients themselves can alter the frequency of the email notifications

In order to do that, access the user profile:

- Collaborator user: click on your picture on the top right corner or access the collaborator users in Settings > my team.
- Client User: access the event homepage of the user and in the block users, click on the selected user picture.

Inside the User's profile, click on notifications and choose the frequency that you want him to receive notifications, as shown in the picture below:
