The event is the center of everything that happens inside mobilize events and probably,
inside your company aswell. Here, every new event has its own section, your own clients,
suppliers, guests, tasks and costs.

Creating the Event

The first step in order to create the event is to click in the button "Add Event"
in the lower left corner of your home page.

You'll be redirected to the event creation process, which is made of 4 steps:
  * Inserting basic information
  * Using an Event Model
  * Inviting the Engaged Couple
  * Starting the management

So, let's get to it! :)

Inserting the basic information

The first screen of the process of creating the event looks like this one:

Event
Ex: Romeu and Juliet's Wedding
Date          Type of Event
10/05/2018    Search
Client
Ex: Romeu Montechio
Estimated number of guests:   Ex: 300
Estimated budget:     U$ Ex: 40000
Add information about the location of the event

Create Event

The first step is to add the basic information of the event:
  1. Event's Name: It's how it's gonna be referenced throughout the App. It's good practice
  to use the Couple's name or something that will help differentiate multiple events
  that you're going to organize.

  2. Event's date: It's mandatory to set a date, but don't worry you'll be able to modify it later.

  3. Type of Event: It's a field intended to group the many types of event that you organize (ex: wedding, graduation party, academics).

  4. Client: It's who is hiring the event organizing company, usually being the engaged couple.
  At this point you only register the client's name, but you'll be able to add more detailed
  information later on.

  5. Estimated number of guests: It's a number that we'll use when you and your clients
  start inputting information into the guest's list.

  6. Estimated Budget: We use this value to estimate the event's costs, providing
  real estimates accordingly to your planned budget.

  7. Location: fill in this field in case you and your clients have already decided the event's location.

All set? Click on Create Event. The first step of the process is done!

Using an Event Model

The Event Models are standarts to help in the management of events, composed of a task list with deadlines
and a standart costs spreadsheet. Click to learn more about the Event Models.

Why use an Event Model?

By using an Event Model throughout the process of creating your New Event you'll
automatically generate:
  * A task list with deadlines according to the event's date.
  * the required products and services for the event and it's estimated costs.

This will save you a lot of time on planning a new event.

Choosing and applying a model

  1. On the second step of the event creation process, you'll see the Event Models available on your platform.

What happens when I invite the engaged couple?

By inviting a fiancée into mobilize events, an invitation is sent into his email,
containing an access *link*, *login* and *password*, just like this one:

//essa aqui eu to susse de traduzir agora, abraços.

Warning! It's important to notice that the engaged couple's login only gives them access to their own event.

Starting to manage
