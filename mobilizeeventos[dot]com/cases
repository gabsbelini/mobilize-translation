1. THAIS MARIANI ADVISORY

Marriage advisor, Maringá - PR

Thais is a marriage ceremonialist and always used to be organized: she used to
create spreadsheets with supplier costs for each event, she had a checklist with
every task that should've been done from the begining of the planning till
the day of the party.

But the more advisory contracts she closed, smaller was her time to keep those
spreadsheets up to date. Occasionally something could go unnoticed and the client
not be informed about a meeting, or she would lost valuable time to find a contract
inside the folders that she used to create for the marriages. Not to mention those
weekends that she spent typing the guest list with over than 300 names that the
brides used to hand over to her.

She used to lost a precious time organizing the task list, costs and guests of
a new marriage.

Thais got stuck to the spreadsheets for a long time, she even found some temporary
solutions like the calendar and the spreadsheets from Google, but even though, the
labor of adding each task was manual and didn't met her needs: there were more and
more marriages, more things to do and remember while the day hours stood the same.

For some time, she kept researching ways of enhance the event management until
a fried of hers (and a client of us)
