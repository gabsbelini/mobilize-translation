What do you get by using the wedding ceremonialist system from mobilize events?

We thought a lot about the professional that makes the advisory and the wedding ceremonial.
The ceremonialist deals with lots of people, lots of information and his time becomes short.

You lose soo much time with querying, checkings, making reports and repetitive tasks.
You receive hundreds of emails, phonecalls and whatsapp messages daily.

The communication with your clients become clearer. And, of course, they love it.

The couple loves it!

The engaged couple notices the differential of your company from the get go. We assure you: you're going to close more deals!

What the ceremonialists say
There is no one better than them to tell you what the marriage advisory system from mobilize does for you,
the wedding ceremonialist.

It eases communication

"The couple themselves access their events and fill in the guest list.
The changes are updated in real time, by doing that we're able to spare lots of time
in phonecalls and emails." Heverthon, from H. Mariani event production and advisory - Maringá - PR

Increases control
"Dude, seriously... This thing was a big found for me. Before this, I always
 had the feeling that something was missing.
 This gave me welfare! When I look there, I see that I have nothing
delayed and my day becomes peaceful."
Flavio Eduardo, from biss band group - maringá - pr.

Management for the Events and the Company
"I'm a fan of the system, so I'm a bit suspicious to say.
Today, we're using it at full steam and we control everything for the company,
from the events to the financial department, which was an obstacle for us
since each client pays in a specific date and we used to get lost because of this."
BRUNA MATOS FROM BELIEVE ADVISORY - SÃO CAETANO DO SUL - SP

IT SPEEDS UP THINGS AND IS A DIFFERENTIAL
"At first sight, when I mention that the event will be organized using a system,
the customers appear to be much more interested. Besides, with MOBILIZE I can
simultaneously manage the more than 40 events that I'm still gonna execute."
THAIS MARIANI EVENT ADVISOR - MARINGÁ - PR.

Ceremonialists from all over the country are already conquering the couples
with MOBILIZE events.
