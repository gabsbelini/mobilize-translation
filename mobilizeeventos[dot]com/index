It eases communication

"The bride and groom themselves access their events and fill in the gust list.
The changes are updated in real time, by doing that we're able to spare lots of time
in phonecalls and emails." Heverthon, from H. Mariani event production and advisory - Maringá - PR

Increases control
"Dude, seriously... This thing was was a big found for me. Before this, I always
 had the feeling that something was missing.
 This gave me welfare! When I look there, I see that I have nothing
delayed and my day becomes peaceful."
Flavio Eduardo, from biss band group - maringá - pr.

Management to the Events and the Company
"I'm a fan of the system, so I'm a bit suspicious to say.
Today, we're using it at full steam and we control everything for the company,
from the events to the financial department, which was an obstacle for us
since each client pays in a specific date and we used to get lost because of this."
BRUNA MATOS FROM BELIEVE ADVISORY - SÃO CAETANO DO SUL - SP

IT SPEEDS UP THINGS AND IS A DIFFERENTIAL
"At first sight, when I show that the event will be managed using a system,
the clients appear to be much more interested. Besides, with MOBILIZE I can
simultaneously manage the more than 40 events that I'm still gonna execute."
THAIS MARIANI EVENT ADVISOR - MARINGÁ - PR.

Ceremonialists from all over the country are already conquering the bride and groom
with MOBILIZE events.
